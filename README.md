# TNH_First-Hallway
My first Take and Hold map! So of course it's a simple hallway with terrible texturing!


After installing WurstMod (https://github.com/Nolenz/WurstMod)
Place this folder in your H3VR\CustomLevels\TakeAndHold Folder.
Load the Take and Hold scene, and then click the side arrows in order to change your Take and Hold map!
